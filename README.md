# ENEE140
This repository contains the projects completed in the class ENEE140: Introduction to Programming Concepts for Engineers. Due to the  obscure and unintuitive nature of Project 2, its program has been omitted.

## Project 1:
This project simulates the variable declaration and initialization process in C. It will print reserved keywords that cannot be used as a variable name and then prompt the user to enter the variable's type, name, and its initial value (optionally). Finally, it will print out the corresponding statement in C for such a variable declaration.

## Project 3:
This project simulates a simplified version of 2-player Monopoly, in which the user will play against the computer. There will be a 20x20 board containing a closed path, with properties that you can purchase and upgrade (twice) afterwards. There will also be chance cards located along the path with different instructions. The game ends when one player runs out of cash and goes bankrupt. To run the program, files containing the path, property, and chance card information must be used. These are included in the Proj3 folder. 

## Project 4:
This program emulates the use of multiple different Python methods/functions on a list (a two dimensional array of strings), described by the starting menu displayed. The file input.txt is an example list that may be used with the program, any other text file with less than 256 characters per line would work as well.
