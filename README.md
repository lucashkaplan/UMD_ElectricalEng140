# ENEE140
This repository contains the projects completed in the class ENEE140: Introduction to Programming Concepts for Engineers.

## Project 1:
This project simulates the variable declaration and initialization process in C. It will print reserved keywords that cannot be used as a variable name and then prompt the user to enter the variable's type, name, and its initial value (optionally). Finally, it will print out the corresponding statement in C for such a variable declaration.

## Project 3:
This project simulates a simplified version of 2-player Monopoly, in which the user will play against the computer. There will be a 20x20 board containing a closed path, with properties that you can purchase and upgrade (twice) afterwards. There will also be chance cards located along the path with different instructions. The game ends when one player runs out of cash and goes bankrupt. To run the program, files containing the path, property, and chance card information must be used. These are included in the Proj3 folder.
